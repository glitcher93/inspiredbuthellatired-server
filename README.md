This website was a project that I executed for a friend. They were looking for a better alternative to having an e-store as the service they werre originally was not benefical to them financially. The client interacting with the website is able to add items to their cart and initiate a purchase. On the administrative side, there is a special login in which the site administrator can manage orders, products, and shipping info.
